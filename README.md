# Psychonauts-Explorer
A program to extract, view and convert resources from the excellent game Psychonauts.

Some of the things that you can do with the latest version of Psychonauts Explorer:

* Open and dump files from all Psychonauts archives.
* Display a preview of (dds) images.
* Save images as JPEG, BMP, PNG or DDS.
* Resize and apply a resampling filter to images.
* Extract and save music and speech as wav and ogg files.
* Work with the PC, XBox and PS2 versions of Psychonauts.
* View the contents of many other Psychonauts files.

**This program is designed for the original version of Psychonauts. The re-released versions on GOG and Steam changed the file formats so some files (like the level .ppf files) wont work. Iâ€™ve added partial support for the re-release to Doublefine Explorer.**
